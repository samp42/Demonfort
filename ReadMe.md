The purpose of this app is to help making workers' pays in time. Workers register their hours every day in the app and send their worksheet. The superintendent then has the task to approve worksheets. If a worksheet is incorrect, the superintendant sends a request for change. The worker then corrects it and send it back. When the superintendent approves the worksheet, the worksheet is sent to the database. On sunday, the worksheets are loaded into a spreadsheet and are sent to the accountant.

# TODO:
- make signup function actually register the user to the database, workers collection
- fetch worksheets (all functions)
- approve worksheet function (for superintendent)
